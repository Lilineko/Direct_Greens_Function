pages={50-55},
abstract={The concept of confinement states that in certain systems the constituent particles are bound together by an interaction for which the strength increases with increasing particle separation. One of the consequences of this is that these individual particles cannot be observed directly. The most famous example of confinement is found in particle physics where baryons and mesons are produced by the confinement of quarks. However, similar phenomena can occur in condensed-matter physics systems such as spin ladders that consist of two spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic chains coupled together by spin exchange interactions. Excitations of individual chains (spinons) carrying spin S=1/2, are confined by even an infinitesimal interchain coupling. Most ladders studied so far cannot illustrate this process because the large strength of their interchain coupling suppresses the spinon excitations at all energy scales. Here we present neutron scattering experiments for a weakly coupled ladder material. At high energies the behaviour of this system approaches that of individual chains, but at low energies it is dominated by the integral spin excitations of strongly coupled chains.},

abstract={Although many experiments imply that oxygen orbitals play an essential role in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates, their precise role in collective spin and charge excitations and superconductivity is not yet fully understood. Here, we study the doping-dependent dynamical spin and charge structure factors of single and multi-orbital (pd) models for doped one-dimensional corner-shared spin-chain cuprates using several numerically exact methods. In doing so, we determine the orbital composition of the collective spin and charge excitations of cuprates, with important implications for our understanding of these materials. For example, we observe a particle-hole asymmetry in the orbital-resolved charge excitations, which is directly relevant to resonant inelastic x-ray scattering experiments and not captured by the single-band Hubbard model. Our results imply that one must explicitly include the oxygen degrees of freedom in order to fully understand some experimental observations on cuprate materials.},

abstract={Quantum effects dominate the behaviour of many diverse materials. Of particular current interest are those systems in the vicinity of a quantum critical point (QCP). Their physical properties are predicted to reflect those of the nearby QCP with universal features independent of the microscopic details. The prototypical QCP is the Luttinger liquid (LL), which is of relevance to many quasi-one-dimensional materials. The magnetic material KCuF3 realizes an array of weakly coupled spin chains (or LLs) and thus lies close to but not exactly at the LL quantum critical point. By using inelastic neutron scattering we have collected a complete data set of the magnetic correlations of KCuF3 as a function of momentum, energy and temperature. The LL description is found to be valid over an extensive range of these parameters, and departures from this behaviour at high and low energies and temperatures are identified and explained.},

  title = {Mottness in high-temperature copper-oxide superconductors},
  journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
  abstract = {The standard theory of metals, Fermi liquid theory, hinges on the key assumption that although the electrons interact, the low-energy excitation spectrum stands in a one-to-one correspondence with that of a non-interacting system. In the normal state of the copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors, drastic deviations from the Fermi liquid picture are obtained, highlighted by a pseudogap, broad spectral features and T-linear resistivity. A successful theory in this context must confront the highly constraining scaling argument which establishes that all 4-Fermi interactions are irrelevant (except for pairing) at a Fermi surface. This argument lays plain that new low-energy degrees of freedom are necessary. This paper focuses on the series of experiments on copper-oxide superconductors which reveal that the number of low-energy addition states per electron per spin exceeds unity, in direct violation of the key Fermi liquid tenet. These experiments point to new degrees of freedom, not made out of the elemental excitations, as the key mechanism by which Fermi liquid theory breaks down in the cuprates. A recent theoretical advance which permits an explicit integration of the high-energy scale in the standard model for the cuprates reveals the source of the new dynamical degrees of freedom at low energies, a charge 2e bosonic field which has nothing to do with pairing but rather represents the mixing with the high-energy scales. We demonstrate explicitly that at half-filling, this new degree of freedom provides a dynamical mechanism for the generation of the charge gap and antiferromagnetism in the insulating phase. At finite doping, many of the anomalies of the normal state of the cuprates including the pseudogap, T-linear resistivity and the mid-infrared band are reproduced. A possible route to superconductivity is explored.}

pages={358-362},
abstract={Polarons--electronic charge carriers 'dressed' by a local polarization of the background environment--are among the most fundamental quasiparticles in interacting many-body systems, and emerge even at the level of a single dopant1. In the context of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, polarons are predicted to form around charged dopants in an antiferromagnetic background in the low-doping regime, close to the Mott insulating state2-7; this prediction is supported by macroscopic transport and spectroscopy measurements in materials?related to high-temperature superconductivity8. Nonetheless, a direct experimental observation of the internal structure of magnetic polarons is lacking. Here we report the microscopic real-space characterization of magnetic polarons in a doped Fermi-Hubbard system, enabled by the single-site spin and density resolution of our ultracold-atom quantum simulator. We reveal the dressing of doublons by a local reduction--and even sign reversal--of magnetic correlations, which originates from the competition between kinetic and magnetic energy in the system. The experimentally observed polaron signatures are found to be consistent with an effective string model at finite temperature7. We demonstrate that delocalization of the doublon is a necessary condition for polaron formation, by comparing this setting with a scenario in which a doublon is pinned to a lattice site. Our work could facilitate the study of interactions between polarons, which may lead to collective behaviour, such as stripe formation, as well as the microscopic exploration of the fate of polarons in the pseudogap and 'bad metal' phases.},

  abstract = {Strongly interacting electrons lined up along a string can experience the so-called spin-charge separation, where the electrons {\textquotedblleft}split{\textquotedblright} into effective carriers of spin and charge, which then move independently. This phenomenon has been observed, somewhat indirectly, in solids. Hilker et al. show spin-charge separation in a direct way by using a one-dimensional (1D) array of cold atoms, playing the role of electrons, whose degrees of freedom of spin and charge can be monitored using a fermionic quantum gas microscope. Empty sites in the 1D lattice moved freely without disturbing the underlying antiferromagnetic order.Science, this issue p. 484Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted magnetic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range antiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.},

abstract={We review the progress in the theory of one-dimensional (ID) Fermi liquids which has occurred over the past decade. The usual Fermi liquid theory, based on a quasi-particle picture, breaks down in one dimension because of the Peierls divergence in the particle-hole bubble, producing anomalous dimensions of operators, and because of charge-spin separation. Both are related to the importance of scattering processes transferring finite momentum. A description of the low-energy properties of gapless 1D quantum systems can be based on the exactly solvable Luttinger model which incorporates these features, and whose correlation functions can be calculated. Special properties of the eigenvalue spectrum, parameterized by one renormalized velocity and one effective coupling constant per degree of freedom, fully describe the physics of this model. Other gapless 1D models share these properties in a low-energy subspace. The concept of a "Luttinger liquid" implies that their low-energy properties are described by an effective Luttinger model, and constitutes the universality class of these quantum systems. Once the mapping on the Luttinger model is achieved, one has an asymptotically exact solution of the 1D many-body problem. Lattice models identified as Luttinger liquids include the 1D Hubbard model off half-filling, and variants such as the t-J- or the extended Hubbard model. In addition, 1D electron-phonon systems or metals with impurities can be Luttinger liquids, as well as the edge states in the quantum Hall effect.}

abstract={Since the seminal ideas of Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless, topological excitations have been at the heart of our understanding of a whole novel class of phase transitions. In most cases, those transitions are controlled by a single type of topological objects. There are, however, some situations, still poorly understood, where two dual topological excitations fight to control the phase diagram and the transition. Finding experimental realizations of such cases is thus of considerable interest. We show here that this situation occurs in BaCo2V2O8, a spin-1/2 Ising-like quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet, when subjected to a uniform magnetic field transverse to the Ising axis. Using neutron scattering experiments, we measure a drastic modification of the quantum excitations beyond a critical value of the magnetic field. This quantum phase transition is identified, through a comparison with theoretical calculations, to be a transition between two different types of solitonic topological object, which are captured by different components of the dynamical structure factor.},

abstract={Polarons---electronic charge carriers `dressed' by a local polarization of the background environment---are among the most fundamental quasiparticles in interacting many-body systems, and emerge even at the level of a single dopant1. In the context of the two-dimensional Fermi--Hubbard model, polarons are predicted to form around charged dopants in an antiferromagnetic background in the low-doping regime, close to the Mott insulating state2--7; this prediction is supported by macroscopic transport and spectroscopy measurements in materials related to high-temperature superconductivity8. Nonetheless, a direct experimental observation of the internal structure of magnetic polarons is lacking. Here we report the microscopic real-space characterization of magnetic polarons in a doped Fermi--Hubbard system, enabled by the single-site spin and density resolution of our ultracold-atom quantum simulator. We reveal the dressing of doublons by a local reduction---and even sign reversal---of magnetic correlations, which originates from the competition between kinetic and magnetic energy in the system. The experimentally observed polaron signatures are found to be consistent with an effective string model at finite temperature7. We demonstrate that delocalization of the doublon is a necessary condition for polaron formation, by comparing this setting with a scenario in which a doublon is pinned to a lattice site. Our work could facilitate the study of interactions between polarons, which may lead to collective behaviour, such as stripe formation, as well as the microscopic exploration of the fate of polarons in the pseudogap and `bad metal' phases.},

abstract = {Strongly interacting chains of fermions are predicted to exhibit two types of collective excitations: spinons, which carry only spin, and holons, which carry only charge. These excitations move at different velocities. Signatures of this so-called spin-charge separation have been observed in solid-state systems, but obtaining direct dynamical evidence is tricky. With this goal in mind, Vijayan et al. perturbed a chain of ultracold interacting fermions housed in a one-dimensional optical lattice by removing one of the atoms. This gave rise to two independent excitations, which the researchers identified as spinons and holons using a quantum gas microscope. Science, this issue p. 186 Quantum gas microscopy is used to track spinons and holons in a 1D optical lattice filled with interacting 6Li atoms. Elementary particles carry several quantum numbers, such as charge and spin. However, in an ensemble of strongly interacting particles, the emerging degrees of freedom can fundamentally differ from those of the individual constituents. For example, one-dimensional systems are described by independent quasiparticles carrying either spin (spinon) or charge (holon). Here, we report on the dynamical deconfinement of spin and charge excitations in real space after the removal of a particle in Fermi-Hubbard chains of ultracold atoms. Using space- and time-resolved quantum gas microscopy, we tracked the evolution of the excitations through their signatures in spin and charge correlations. By evaluating multipoint correlators, we quantified the spatial separation of the excitations in the context of fractionalization into single spinons and holons at finite temperatures.}
